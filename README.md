## Overview

So I wanted to rewrite my project 'Curriculum-Vitae' with only JavaScript. 
So in this repository is the backend part of it. 

The frontend is coming later on the repository 'Tineit-frontend'.

Keyword for the backend: ['Node', 'Express', 'Mongo', 'Mongoose', 'Jsonwebtoken' ]

## Motivation

First motivation for my old project 'Curriculum-Vitae', I created it because my school was running to an end.
So I wanted to have something to send to companies that not only wanted to see a piece of paper, and actually check out my
 programming skills at a website.

## Installation

To install this and try out the server you need to install this on your machine.

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Then you download the repository [here](https://github.com/Tinee/Curriculum-Vitae/archive/master.zip)

then you unzip the file and place it in your favourite folder.

Then you navigate to the folder with your terminal.

Example:
```
cd ./documents/downloads
```

And when your in your awesome folder where you put the project you simple run:
```
npm install
```
then
```
npm start
```

This will the start the server and listens to port 3000 by default. 

So try to navigate to http://localhost:3000/

and you should see a simple website.


## API Calls

Its a lot of different api calls to the server, so check out in the code and try them out.
> Documentation for all the api calls is coming later.
